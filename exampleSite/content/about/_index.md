Hi I'm Ruth.

Welcome to my personal blog.

## **My story**

After studying for a degree in Art and Textile Design. The dreaded thought "what do I do next haunted me?". So I did what everyone else does. I got a job. I worked as a care assistant for a few years to support myself.

But as much as I loved working in Health and Social Care. Something was missing. It didn't cater to my creative nature. So I decided to become an Art Teacher.

I enrolled on a PGCE program. I loved it initially but my excitement slowly turned to dread. So I knew this wasn't the career for me. I dropped out of my PGCE. Penniless and desperate I knew I had to get my life together fast.

I used the remnants of my student loan to pay for a course in Teaching English as a Foreign Language. After a month of intensive training, I received my TESOL certificate.

Soon after I was jetting off to Spain to teach English. Spain led to teaching and living in Vietnam for 4 years.

Around that time the print on demand trend was booming. So, I decided to hop on that wagon. I had worked remotely before as some of my teaching days included teaching online. So I knew I would be comfortable working remotely.

I got online and created an activewear shop on Shopify called Enius Boutique. I worked from morning till night on my business. But still no clients. My heart sank and I thought to myself. "What am I doing wrong?" Eventually, my business venture came to a close.

My frustration triggered an obsession to learn how to market. Since then, I have dedicated my free time to studying marketing.

So far, I have completed a Level 4 in Copywriting and am in the midst of completing a Level 4 in Social Media Marketing. I hope to complete a certificate in SEO at a later date.

All this studying inspired me to share the knowledge gained from my courses on my blog to help others market their businesses online.

When I am not writing, you will find me reading, travelling, working out, crocheting and watching movies with my family.
