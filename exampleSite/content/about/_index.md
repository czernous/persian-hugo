## **My story before copywriting**

After studying for a degree in Art and Textile Design. The dreaded thought "what do I do next haunted me?". So I picked up whatever job I could and worked as a care assistant for several years.

As much as I loved care something was missing. It didn't cater to my creative nature. So I decided to become an Art Teacher.

I enrolled on a PGCE program. But again something didn't feel right. So, I dropped out of my PGCE. Penniless and desperate I knew I had to get my life together fast.

I used the remnants of my student loan to pay for a course in Teaching English as a Foreign Language. After a month of intensive training, I received my Trinity TESOL certificate.

The next thing I knew I was jetting off to Spain to teach. Spain led to teaching in Vietnam. After years of living in Vietnam and in other countries.

I kept being bombarded with thoughts of owning an online business. I had worked remotely before as some of my teaching days included teaching online. So I felt comfortable working independently.

I got online and researched ways to make money. I came across print on demand. So I decided to use my designing skills to create an activewear brand. Although, I knew how to design I had no idea about marketing. So my business venture came to a quick close.

It was then I took it upon myself to figure out this thing called marketing. Since then, I have dedicated time to studying this topic.

I have completed a Level 4 in Copywriting and am in the midst of completing a Level 4 in Social Media Marketing. I also love to read blogs and watch Youtube videos on this topic. So it seemed natural to put my knowledge to good use by creating this blog.

As well as marketing, I am also very passionate about Fashion, Beauty, and Textiles.

When I am not writing, you will find me reading, shopping, travelling, working out, and watching movies with my family.
