After numerous hair disasters, I decided to dedicate time to write articles to help others with their hair and beauty issues.

You might be sick of getting your hair ruined by stylists or maybe you want to save your hard-earned cash for other expenses.

Therefore my blog will contain DIY content so that you can carry out simple hair and beauty procedures at home. It will also be a platform to discuss my favourite products.

###### **DISCLAIMER**

I am not a qualified hairdresser or beautician. My content is based on research and procedures I have practised at home. So, please also do additional research before you try these methods.

###### **WORK WITH ME**

If you are interested in content for your business, Iâ€™m your girl. I am a qualified copywriter specialising in writing blog and social media copy within the hair and beauty niche.

Previously, I have worked in telesales selling beauty products for the company my perfect eyes, and I have just enrolled in a course in Level 2 Beauty Therapy. I also hold qualifications in braiding hair, microrings, and fusion extensions.
