Is your goal to build brand awareness or enter a new market?

If so, I use my background in Education and Art to can help you promote your business by writing blog and social posts.

Often businesses forget that the best way to persuade clients to buy from you is by focusing on them and giving them value first before asking for a sale.

Ask Dan Lok says " For every 1000 dollars they need to consume at least 1 hour of your content"

So if you're ready to build trust by becoming an authority in your niche.  And want potential clients coming to you rather than constantly approaching them.

## **My story**

After studying for a degree in Art and Textile Design. The dreaded thought "what do I do next haunted me?". So I did what everyone else does. I got a job. I worked as a care assistant for a few years to support myself.

But as much as I loved working in Health and Social Care. Something was missing. It didn't cater to my creative nature. So I decided to become an Art Teacher.

I enrolled on a PGCE program. I loved it initially but my excitement slowly turned to dread. So I knew this wasn't the career for me. I dropped out of my PGCE. Penniless and desperate I knew I had to get my life together fast.

I used the remnants of my student loan to pay for a course in Teaching English as a Foreign Language. After a month of intensive training, I received my TESOL certificate.

Soon after I was jetting off to Spain to teach English. Spain led to teaching and living in Vietnam for 4 years.

Around that time the print on demand trend was booming. So, I decided to hop on that wagon. I had worked remotely before as some of my teaching days included teaching online. So I knew I would be comfortable working remotely.

I got online and created an activewear shop on Shopify called Enius Boutique. I worked from morning till night on my business. But still no clients. My heart sank and I thought to myself. "What am I doing wrong?" Eventually, my business venture came to a close.

My frustration triggered an obsession to learn how to market. Since then, I have dedicated my free time to studying marketing.

So far, I have completed a Level 4 in Copywriting and am in the midst of completing a Level 4 in Social Media Marketing. I hope to complete a certificate in SEO at a later date.

All this studying inspired me to share the knowledge gained from my courses on my blog to help other creatives market their businesses online.

Marketing isn't an area of focus on creative courses. Even though funny enough it is one of the most important aspects of being an artist or designer. So my blog fills that knowledge gap.

When I am not writing, you will find me reading, travelling, working out, crocheting and watching movies with my family.
