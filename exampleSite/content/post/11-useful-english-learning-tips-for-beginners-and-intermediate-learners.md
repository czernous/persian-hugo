+++
During my years as an English teacher, I came across many students who said they had been studying for years. So, I was surprised when I realized some of them couldn’t speak a lick of English.

The problem with the educational system is that it focuses on building skills in reading and writing which are the perfect skills to pass exams.

But passing exams doesn’t help you communicate with native speakers, speak to colleagues or help you get around in a foreign country.

This is why I believe you should make improving your speaking and listening skills your primary focus.

Then build upon your knowledge from listening. By reading and improving your vocabulary and finally work on your writing skills.

So if you find learning English stressful? Or you find that you have studied English for years but you still struggle to speak fluently.

Don't worry I'm here to help. With these English learning tips for beginners and intermediate learners, you will learn at a quicker pace and build your confidence in speaking English.

So let's begin:

## **Visit an English speaking country**

Let me begin with a story. Whilst travelling I met my husband who speaks fluent Russian. I didn't have any previous exposure to the language. My husband speaks fluent English so we always communicated in English.

Then I travelled with him to Russia. I must say I felt like a fish out of water. But after 2 visits to Russia, I noticed I had picked up some vocabulary from listening to conversations with him and his mother.

I picked up some useful words and some swear words which I will not be repeating here. But the point is I picked up new words through passive learning.

I didn’t spend hours drilling vocabulary lists and going over flashcards. Mind you flashcards are a good method of learning. But I think this is best when you are already familiar with a few words.

## **Listen to English every day**

This follows on from visiting an English speaking country. But I understand that not everyone has the opportunity to do that. So what else can you do?

* Hang out with people that speak English in your country
* Watch movies with subtitles
* Listen to songs in English
* Listen to podcasts.

## **Learn English in phrases and sentences**

So you now know a few words. It's now time to get the flashcards out. Create flashcards using phrases and sentences.

By doing this you will learn more words and you will understand how words are used together.

You will also spend less time studying grammar as you will learn it organically.

This is because when you learn vocabulary and grammar separately, you spend time connecting the right word to the correct grammar usage.

## **Remember vocabulary by using actions**

Aside from flashcards, you can use actions to help you remember new words. Think of actions for phrases on your vocabulary list.

Why? Because when we listen to words and repeat them, we only use the left side of the brain.

But by only using this side of the brain, you will find it difficult to remember phrases, if they aren’t reviewed regularly.

Movement allows you to use both sides of your brain. This helps you learn words quickly and retain them.

This technique is best used for verbs. Abstract ideas don't work as well. For instance, can you think of an action related to English learning tips for beginners? Hard isn't it?

## **Post-it notes**

This isn't a method I have personally tried when learning a language. But my husband used it at the beginning stages of his language learning. He wrote different words in English and stuck them around his house.

For instance, if he wanted to remember the word "fridge". He would write it on a post-it and stick it on his fridge. So naturally, he would review the word every time he went to his fridge.

## **Repetition**

How many times have you done something over and over again until it becomes automatic? A bit like riding a bike or driving. Learning a language is the same. It requires you to build muscle memory.

To learn a new word you need to have repeated it at least 70 times. So make sure you are practising every day. It is better to practise English for 10 mins every day than 1 hour a week.

## **Use materials made for natives**

I will be blunt here. Don’t use textbooks to study. They are boring and don't represent how English is used by natives in real life.

Natives use a lot of slang and idioms when speaking and most textbooks don’t use language like this.

Instead:

* Read fiction and non-fiction books
* Magazines
* Newspapers
* Blogs

Reading is a great way to improve your vocabulary. And make sure you use reading materials that allow you to understand 75% of the vocabulary.

You shouldn’t be using a dictionary all the time. And if you're a beginner read children’s books and comics.

## **Practise speaking**

You don't need a native speaker to practice speaking. If you're friends with natives. Great! But if not practise speaking to yourself. I often speak to myself about things I need to do. So instead of doing that in your mother tongue, try doing that in English.

## **Practise pronunciation**

I can't stress how important pronunciation is when it comes to speaking. I have met people who are fluent speakers. But because of poor pronunciation, I could barely understand what they are saying.

Try shadowing to improve your pronunciation. Shadowing is when you listen and imitate a native speaker.

To begin, find a video or audio by a native speaker and the audio script.

Read out the script at the same time as the audio, imitate the pace, pitch and intonation of the speaker, do this until you can remember the script without the words.

Keep changing the audio and increase the difficulty each time to challenge yourself.

## **Devices**

Did you know switching your phone, tablet, PC to English can help improve your English? As the more you make English a part of your normal life, the more you start thinking in English rather than translating in your head.

## **Get a diary**

This method I found recently from[ proofreadingservices.com](https://www.proofreadingservices.com/). It isn't suitable for complete beginners. But it is useful if you have some knowledge of English. Buy a journal and regularly write down your thoughts in English.

## **Finally**

Learning a new language can be frustrating and challenging. But it can also be an exhilarating and life-changing experience. If you stay persistent it can give you opportunities you never thought possible.

I hope this article will give you the motivation to keep strong, keep smiling and keep practising English.
