There's a reason why experts suggest coming up with 25 headlines before choosing the final one for your article.

Because no matter how valuable and interesting your content is. Without good headlines, readers won’t click through and read your content.

So always make sure to spend enough time writing your headlines.

In this article, I will share 15 principles of writing good headlines.

So let’s dive in.

![List of 15 principles of writing good headlines](https://res.cloudinary.com/ruthchernous/image/upload/v1632162632/15_principles_of_writing_good_headlines_kigwu0.jpg "15 principles of writing good headlines")

## **1. Tell your readers what your copy is about.**

As an avid reader, I have come across my fair share of clickbait headlines. Yes, I get it.

Writing clickbait headlines does work and you will probably get clicks to your content.

But what happens when your audience clicks on a headline to find out your content has nothing to do with it?

I am sure you have been in the same boat. What did you do? Let me guess. You got frustrated and left the page.

So long story short it is better to create a headline that may not be exciting. But gets to the point and leads your readers to what is promised on your page.

Rather than to write a headline that is clickbaity, serves no purpose and offers nothing in relation to the content.

## **2. Make them curious**

Nobody likes to be left out. I remember being at school, overhearing my friends gossip about who is now going out with who.

Immediately, I wanted in on the conversation. Your potential customers are the same. Give them part of the news in the headline and leave it up to them to find out the rest.

## **3. Be conversational**

Copywriting isn't like academic writing. No one cares about how good your vocabulary is and how much you know if what you know isn’t beneficial to them.

Your readers want to feel like they are communicating with you on a friendship level. Think about it. If you were writing to a friend? How would you speak to them?

An easy way to do this is to create a persona and write to them.

## **4. Ask questions**

I love asking questions in my headline. When you ask questions, readers are curious to find answers. Your content is the perfect opportunity for them to do so.

## **5. Evoke emotions**

How many times have you been moved by a good headline? Were you able to stop yourself from clicking on it?

When you evoke strong feelings with your content. Your readers feel inspired to take action like sharing your information with others.

## **6. Motivate**

People love to be inspired to make a positive change to their life or to the world. So if your headline contains information like Start a vegan diet. Or look 10 years younger. And you can back it up with evidence to help them achieve that goal. You will get potential customers scrolling through your article.

## **7. Use a powerful first word**

I came across this method in my copywriting course and on Neil Patel's blog. Neil refers to them as Rationals. Basically, they are words that tell you why you should do something.

For instance:

Ideas for making delicious desserts

Secrets to making delicious desserts

Principles to making delicious desserts

Tricks to making delicious desserts

Tips to making delicious desserts

## **8. Use numbered lists**

Readers love lists because the information is scannable, easy to remember and readers know what to expect from your content. Numbers also perform well in Google. But weirdly odd numbers tend to do better than even numbers.

## **9. Add keywords**

Writing headlines online and for blogs differ from writing for print. Headlines in this case need to contain keywords that your readers are searching for.

You can find keywords using SEMrush or Ahfrefs. Enter your topic into a keyword search bar and look for keywords that have high search traffic and low difficulty.

Low difficulty is when fewer people are searching for the same keywords. This gives you more chance to rank for those keywords. Keywords with 3 or more words are generally easier to rank for.

## **10. Make your headlines short**

Your headlines shouldn’t be longer than 8 words. And if you are writing online it shouldn’t be over 55 characters. Your headline should include several short words. Ideally, your words shouldn’t be over 2 syllables.

## **11. Test your headlines**

After creating a load of headlines it is a good idea to check how effective and click-worthy they are. Co schedule analyser and Aminstitute are good tools to use.

## **12. Name drop**

I recently found out about this technique from [**Nathan Gotch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5qqW6NH7mc&ab_channel=NathanGotch "Name dropping")**.** Namedropping is when you use a famous brand in your article’s headline. The idea is to get traffic from their name.

E.g. Why McDonald's should focus on a content marketing strategy.

## **13. Compare two topics**

This is another technique mentioned by Nathan Gotch. You might have seen headlines like Web Design vs Graphic Design. These headlines usually address two main ideas. Giving pros and cons as to why you should use a product or get into a specific sector.

## **14.  Use headline formulas**

For some reason when I started using headline formulas it felt like cheating but I came to realize that it isn’t and it works.

Headline formulas have been tested by other marketers and the fact that they are still being used means that they are effective.

Use a combination of different formulas to inspire you to come up with a list of different headlines.

Then use a headline analyzer to choose the most effective one.

## **15. Be specific**

There is nothing wrong with being creative in your headlines. But make sure your headlines include what is coming up next and what is in store for the reader. Steer away from writing anything vague.

## **Bottom line**

If you want to use copywriting tactics to drive traffic to your business. You need to be able to write headlines. Good headlines will encourage potential customers to read your content and lead them to take action.

So what techniques do you use when creating your headlines?

How many headlines do you create before choosing the right one?
