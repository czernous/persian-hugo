Suffering from artist block is something that all artists can relate to. For those of you who haven’t experienced this, artist block is when you cannot generate ideas.

This can leave you feeling frustrated and unmotivated. Luckily there are ways to tackle this and get your creative juices flowing.

## **Mind map**

If you find yourself staring at a blank page, one thing you can do is to create a mind map.

Draw a circle in the middle of your sketchbook and write down the topic of your project. Then, write down keywords related to your topic of choice.

## **Inspiration boards**

After creating a mindmap, choose a few keywords that grab your interest. Find images using those keywords online.

Or you can also take your own photographs. Create several themed boards. 3- 5 [inspiration boards](https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/mood-boards-812470 "Moodboards") are plenty.

## **Other artists**

Another way to spark inspiration is to look at the work created by others. Take a trip to an art gallery or look through books. Study techniques created by the masters and try to imitate them. You never know where it might take you.

## **Trends**

To create something sellable, it is important for you to look at trends. Look through fashion and textile magazines and look at what is popular.

Ideally, you should look at and use trends that are not yet available. You can use trend forecasting tools or simply do some research on the net.

## **Music**

When going through an artistic block, the last thing you want to do is stress out. This can make the situation worse.

Make a cup of tea and relax to some music. Get out your sketchbook and simply draw what emotion comes to mind. These might be abstract or figurative shapes. Experiment with various materials.

## **Go for a walk**

Leaving your house can be the perfect solution for your artistic block. Go into your garden or go for a walk. Don’t forget to take your camera or your sketchbook to capture anything which fascinates you.

## **Television**

This might not come to mind when you think of creativity. But watching your favourite shows can be a great source of inspiration.

Whilst watching television, try sketching what you see. This can be anything on the box which is interesting to you.

## **Challenges**

Taking part in challenges has been a popular choice to get involved in a community full of like-minded individuals.

Why not take part in a challenge on social media or create a challenge of your own. What’s more inspiring than sharing your artwork with other creatives.

## **Trade shows**

Like exhibitions, trade shows are the perfect place to network and look at products, showcased by other artists.

It is a great way of finding out about new and upcoming artists. When going to a tradeshow make sure to collect business cards, so you can use this information to do further research at home.

## **Journaling**

Writing your thoughts and feelings in a diary is a therapeutic process that can be used to stimulate creativity. You could create artwork based on your journal entries.

## **Magazines and Newspapers**

I love this method of finding inspiration as magazines and newspapers are accessible to everyone.

Don’t overthink this process. Simply pull out images that you are drawn to. Once you have finished, look through the images you’ve collected. You will notice that most of the images you’ve chosen fall into similar themes that can be put together to create inspiration boards.

If you are interested in creating word art, go through a magazine and cross out words with a black marker leaving out words you are drawn to. Once you have finished, you can use these words to create a poem, or as a starting point for a drawing or a painting.

## **Museums and Galleries**

If you have the weekend off, pop to a museum. Make it a day trip with your friends or family. Sketch interesting artefacts. Note down why they are interesting and remember to jot down any details like the artist and the period. 

## **Trends**

You can't skip doing research into trends when designing commercially. Predicting trends ensures that your designs are marketable to a targeted audience. Designs are usually done a year in advance. So, if you wish to experiment with this method. Always look for trends for the following year.

## **Social Media**

With content being pushed out on a daily basis, there is no shortage of inspiration on social media. I love Pinterest as half the work is done for you. Simply drag and drop images that appeal to you.

## **Collectables**

Who else loves shopping at markets and thrift shops? I know I do, you never know what you can find. Put these items in boxes at home and then they are ready for you to use whenever you need them.

When you are ready, look at the items and study them through drawings. Document aspects of the item. What does the shape look like? Is it made from any interesting materials? 

## **Home**

Home is where the heart is and it is also a hub to find inspiration for your work. Just have a look around and you might be surprised at what you find. Take photographs of anything that catches your eye. You could start doing prints with items of food. Fruit and vegetables make great stencils for printing.

## **Create samples**

Sometimes the best way of finding inspiration is by experimenting. Did you come across a technique you were dying to try? Just do it. Start creating samples using this technique and see where it leads you.

## **Finally**

Creating artwork doesn’t have to be difficult. With these ideas under your belt, you can say goodbye to staring at a blank page and begin your creative process with excitement and ease.
