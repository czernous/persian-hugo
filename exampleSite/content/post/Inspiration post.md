**Magazines and Newspapers**

I love this method of finding inspiration as magazines and newspapers are accessible to everyone.

Don’t overthink this process. Simply pull out images that you are drawn to. Once you have finished, look through the images you’ve collected. You will notice that most of the images you’ve chosen fall into similar themes that can be put together to create inspiration boards.

In this picture you can see images that I have collected intuitively. These images form different categories. Some are purple in colour and others are glitz and glam.

If you are interested in creating word art, go through a magazine and cross out words with a black marker leaving out words you are drawn to. Once you have finished, you can use these words to create a poem, or as a starting point for a drawing or a painting.

**Look in Nature**

If you are an active type, go for a nice long walk. Or if time is limited, have a wander around your garden. You will be surprised at what you can find. Don’t forget to take a camera or sketchbook with you.

Look for interesting plants, bugs, anything that captures your interest and document them in your sketchbook.

The idea here is not to come back with a finished drawing but to capture interesting parts of what you see.

Imagine yourself as an investigator wanting to capture everything about your target. Document colours, interesting textures, shapes, and patterns.

**Museums and Galleries.**

If you have the weekend off, pop to a museum. Make it a day trip with your friends or family. Sketch interesting artifacts. Note down why they are interesting and remember to jot down any details like the artist and the period. So you can do further research at home.

**Journalling**

Journaling is not only therapeutic, it is a brilliant source of inspiration for your artwork. I have one in my handbag. I regularly jot down my feelings and memories. Whatever you’re feeling can easily be transferred into artwork that can be developed further.

This method is very personal. So if you are looking to create work that evokes emotion and gives your audience an insight into your inner world. This option is definitely suitable for you.

**Trends**

You can't skip doing research into trends when designing commercially. Predicting trends ensures that your designs are marketable to a targeted audience. Designs are usually done a year in advance. So, if you wish to experiment with this method. Always look for trends for the following year.

**Social Media**

With content being pushed out on a daily basis, there is no shortage of inspiration on social media. Especially Pinterest. I love pinterest as half the work is done for you. Your boards are already built for you. So you simply need to drag and drop images that appeal to you.

**Collectibles**

Who else loves shopping at markets and thrift shops. I know I do, you never know what you can find. Put these items in boxes at home and then they are ready for you to use whenever you need them.

When you are ready, look at the items and study them through drawings. As previously mentioned, document aspects of the item. What does the shape look like? Is it made from any interesting materials? Look at the texture, pattern of the object and document this in your sketchbook.

**Other artist’s work**

I am forever looking at other artists' work. You can find images and content of their work on google. Alternatively look at the sites like the Tate, MOMA, Victoria and Albert. All these museums have their own website where you can do research on different artists. Sites like Behance and dribble also have a wealth of information about other people’s work.

**Home**

Home is where the heart is and it is also a hub to find inspiration for your work. Just have a look around and you might be surprised at what you find. Take photographs of anything that catches your eye. You could even start doing prints with items of food. Fruit and Vegetables make great stencils for printing.

**Mindmap**

Some people need more structure when it comes to research. A mind map will give you just that. To begin, draw a circle in the middle of your page. Choose a theme and write down anything that corresponds to that theme.

From there you can start collecting images based on what you’ve written or jump straight into drawing. Your drawings and images can be used to start a moodboard.

So next time you find yourself staring at a blank page in your sketchbook. Remember inspiration is all around you. Don’t sweat the small stuff, just have a look around.
