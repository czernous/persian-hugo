As black women our hair is susceptible to breakage. Our curly strands make it difficult for natural oils to travel down the hair shaft making it easy for strands to snap off.

Causing breakage and giving us the label “ black hair doesn’t grow”. However there are certain things we can do to prevent this like adding castor oil to your hair regime.

Castor oil comes from the seed Ricinus Communis. It is found in Eastern Africa, India and the Mediterranean. The oil is extracted from the seed and cold pressed giving it a pale yellow colour.

The other type is called the Jamaican black castor oil. The process is different as the seeds are roasted and then vapourized in a mortar.

It is then boiled producing a dark brown colour. Castor oil has many uses such as pain relief, skin and hair treatment. It is found in various types of cosmetics ranging from lipsticks to deodorants. So how is it beneficial for your hair? In this article I will include:

**Benefits**

Well, most oils are made of different combinations of fatty acids. Castor oil is different because it contains a fatty acid called Ricinoleic.

This fatty acid has elements that are anti-inflammatory and antifungal. It also increases circulation by attracting moisture from the environment to your hair and skin.

Most oils only contain a fraction of this fatty acid whereas castor oil contains 85%-95% of it. It is absorbent and rarely irritates the skin. However some people might face allergies. So it is advisable to test the oil on a small area of skin before application.

**Choosing the right oil**

When it comes to the best castor for hair growth. The jamaican castor oil is better for those with thick, coarse hair.

It has a potent smell which can be overwhelming for those who aren’t used to strong smells. Adding essential oils like Lavender and Tea Tree can alleviate this.

Combining rosemary oil with castor oil also benefits your hair by aiding hair growth. It can also be used for growing your eyebrows.

**Disadvantages of castor oil for hair**

Although castor oil rarely irritates the skin. You can’t predict how it will react to yours. So it is advisable to test it on a small area of skin before application. To avoid staining your sheets, cover your hair or your pillow before going to sleep.

You might be thinking, can you put castor oil in your hair everyday? Yes, you can, as a hair moisturizer. But because of the thickness of the oil, build up can occur. So wash your hair once a month with a clarifying shampoo or use an apple cider vinegar rinse.

**Usage**

_Washing your Hair_

Washing your hair with shampoos can strip the natural oils making it dry and prone to breakage. Pre- pooing your hair with castor oil will protect and leave it moisturised throughout the washing process.

* Add a few drops of caster oil all over your hair
* Leave for 4-8 hours
* Shampoo your hair

_Moisturizing your hair_

Apply the oil to your scalp. Massage the oil with your fingers or use a scalp massager. You can get these on Amazon for a decent price. Massaging your scalp will enable faster hair growth by stimulating your hair follicles.

_Conditioning your hair_

We all know conditioning strengthens hair and stops damage. Apply the oil straight onto your hair. Put on a plastic cap and sit under a heat cap for 30 minutes. Then rinse. Alternatively leave it overnight and rinse it out in the morning.

_Styling your hair_

Creating your own pomade will not only allow you to style your hair but will provide you with other benefits. To begin:

* Get a tin and sterilize it with some rubbing alcohol
* Melt the same amount of beeswax and castor oil. You can also use petroleum jelly instead of beeswax.
* Fill a pan halfway with water and put it on a stove
* Put a bowl inside the pan. Add the wax and castor oil in the bowl
* Once it has melted, mix and let it cool down
* Add some essential oils to the mixture. Don’t use more than 2 drops of essential oils to 1 tbsp of castor oil and beeswax
* Pour the pomade into the tin and allow it to cool

**Final Thoughts**

So does Jamaican castor oil really grow your hair? Well, no one can really answer that question. Hair comes in different textures and lengths so no one can predict how the oil will react to yours. But facts do state that it increases hair thickness, density, and strength which naturally will allow you to retain length.
