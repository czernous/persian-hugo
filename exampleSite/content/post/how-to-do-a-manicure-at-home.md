When you think about self-care. Knowing how to do a manicure at home may not be on the top of your list.

But a lack of nail care can lead to infections. This is because your nail cuticles act as a barrier, protecting it from infection and stopping the infection from travelling to your bloodstream.

Damage to your cuticles can be caused by biting your nails, trimming your cuticles, using too much nail polish remover or having a vitamin deficiency. So how can damage be prevented?

By having regular manicures as part of your self-care routine. Getting a manicure doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive. In fact, with just a few items under your sleeve, you can do your nails from the comfort of your kitchen table.

So in this article, I will share with you a simple manicure you can do at home.

**Materials**

Nail file

Cuticle pusher

Cuticle clipper

Nail Buffer

Basecoat

Nail polish

Nail polish remover

Clear topcoat

Acetone

Paintbrush or makeup brush

Small glass container

Cuticle remover (optional)

## **Step 1- Remove your nail polish**

A manicure starts with cleaning your nails with nail polish remover and a cotton pad. There are 2 types of nail polish: acetone and non-acetone. I always use an acetone-based one as the non-acetone is for use on false nails. 

Wash your hands afterwards. If you don’t have any previous nail polish do this step anyway as it removes dirt and debris from the nail and will give you a better finish.

## **Step 2 - Clip, File and Buff your nails**

Using a nail clipper, clip your nail to the desired length and file them to a shape of your choice. The 6 main shapes are square, coffin, oval, squoval, almond, coffin, and stiletto. I opted for a square one as this is my natural shape and I wanted to enhance it.

## **Step 3 - Soak your nails**

Fill a small bowl with lukewarm water and a few drops of essential oils. Soak for 3 minutes on each hand**.** This softens the cuticle and gets them ready to be pushed back.

## **Step 4 - Push back cuticles**

You can also apply cuticle remover to the cuticle. Push back cuticles with a cuticle stick or a cuticle pusher. Do this gently to avoid damage to the cuticle. 

Some people like to cut the excess skin but I recommend skipping this as it can put your cuticles at risk of a nail infection. 

Gently nip the free edge with cuticle nippers and remove hangnails.

## **Step 5- Moisturize hands**

Moisturize your hands in circular movements and whilst doing so give yourself a massage with your thumb. I use a Nivea moisturiser. Wipe your nails with nail polish remover to prevent chipping.

## **Step 6 - Application**

Apply a base coat. This gives your manicure a solid foundation and prevents nail discolouration.

To apply the base coat, paint down the middle of the nail, then the left side and the right. Only 3 stripes are needed to cover the nail. Wait for 3 minutes between each coat.

Now start on your polish. Apply 2 coats. Then apply your clear topcoat. 

## **Step 7 - Cleanup**

I like to clean up any mistakes by pouring acetone into a small glass container. Then I dip a makeup or paintbrush in the acetone and wipe around the nail. 

Let your nails dry for 5 minutes. Follow up with applying cuticle oil to your cuticles. Cuticle oil moisturises your nails and prevents them from damage.

## **Conclusion**

Manicures are fun and easy to do with just investing in a few items. You can start doing your own manicures in no time.
