It is easy to make the mistake of buying skin-care products based on either the fragrance or brand. However, this is unlikely to get you good results. You should take into consideration the ingredients listed on the packaging.

Many cosmetic brands use cheap ingredients to create their products. So when buying a beauty product, look for ingredients that have been scientifically proven to enhance your skin.

Look for ingredients like Retinol, Sulfur, Salicylic Acid, Witch hazel, Glycolic Acid and Lactic Acid.

Also, you don’t need a huge budget. A basic skincare routine that consists of cleansing, exfoliating and moisturising twice a day is more than enough to take good care of your skin. But your skin care routine should cater to your skin type.

So how can we identify the different skin types? In this article, I will discuss various skin types and how to get fabulous skin using a simple 3 step routine.

## **Oily skin**

Large pores and shine go hand in hand with oily skin. This is because this skin type produces too much oil which clogs up your pores and leads to spots.

Using a salicylic acid cleanser reduces the overproduction of oil and reduces the size of pores. It also removes dead skin cells and reduces discolouration. Opt for a gel or foam cleanser as it doesn’t weigh down the skin like Cera Ve Foaming Facial Cleanser.

When choosing a toner look for ingredients like beta-hydroxy acids or polyhydroxy acids as they are great for clearing your pores and reducing oil production.

To avoid drying out your skin, also look for ingredients like aloe vera. Avoid toners with alcohol and witch hazel as they are too harsh on the skin. Try Kiehl’s Blue Astringent Herbal Lotion.

You might be tempted to skip the moisturizer if you have oily skin. But oily skin also needs to be hydrated to avoid wrinkles and premature ageing.

Follow up with oil-free moisturizers like Cetaphil DermaControl Oil Absorbing Moisturizer SPF 30 or La Roche- Posay Effaclar Mat Oil-free Mattifying Moisturizer.

This will ensure your skin is kept moisturised and soft. Avoid moisturizers with mineral oil and petroleum and go for non-comedogenic as they don’t clog up your pores.

If your moisturizer doesn’t include an SPF. Finishing your routine with a lightweight SPF will protect your skin from UV rays.

## **Combination skin**

Both oily and dry areas are found on people with a combination skin type. Usually, spots and blemishes are found on their T zone area; cheeks, face and chin.

A cream cleanser will moisturise this skin type as well as unclog pores and control oil. Try CeraVe Hydrating cream to foam cleanser which starts as a cream but turns to foam so works for both areas of your face.

Follow up with an exfoliant with fruit enzymes like Sugar Face Polish Exfoliator. It is a scrub with brown sugar and strawberries.

Look for toners that contain antioxidants. As they protect your skin from free radicals and rebalance your skin’s pH level.

You also want one that is alcohol-free as alcohol dries out your skin. Retaining moisture is key for combination skin so look for toners with humectant hyaluronic acid and ceramides.

Finish with an oil-free moisturiser like Neutrogena Hydro Boost or CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion.

## **Sensitive skin**

With sensitive skin an allergic reaction is likely. You might experience stinging, burning, redness or itchiness when applying certain products. So avoid products with harsh chemicals and go for ones that are gentle on the skin.

Use a cream cleanser instead of using foam cleansers and manual exfoliators. Try CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser or Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.

Go for a toner that is alcohol-free and contains hyaluronic acid, aloe vera or rose water. Hypoallergenic formulas are also a good shout. Try Immortelle Essential Water.

In terms of a moisturiser avoid products with glycolic, lactic and salicylic acid and choose products that soothe and hydrate the skin. Avoid perfumed products. Try CeraVe Daily Moisturising Lotion or Simple Kind to Skin Moisturizer.

## **Dry skin**

If your skin feels flaky, tight and lacks moisture you probably have dry skin. You will find that you are susceptible to wrinkles and fine lines.

A Cleansing milk will gently remove dry flakes and fine lines without drying out your skin. Try Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser.

A toner that hydrates your skin is perfect for this skin type. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, fruit oils and aloe vera. Try Fresh Rose and Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Toner. Finish with Cetaphil moisturizing cream.

## **Normal**

With this skin type, you might see yourself lucky as most products are suitable for your skin type. You don’t have to contend with any oiliness, dry skin, large pores or spots.

Try Mario Badescu Enzyme Cleansing Gel to wash. To tone try Kate Somerville Liquid Exfolikate or Clean and Clear lemon juice toner. And to moisturise La Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturize**r.**

## **Final thoughts**

Skin reminds me of people. They don’t come in different shapes and sizes but they do come in different textures and have different needs. One product and skincare routine doesn’t fit all.

As long as you use the right products and stick to a routine that supports your specific skin type. There is no reason why you can’t have beautiful, glowing skin.
