Engaging with customers instead of bombarding them with promotions has become the preferred way to advertise. This is why Advertorials are a great option when it comes to promoting your service or product. In this article, I will discuss how advertorials can help your business and how to create one.

## **What is an Advertorial?**

Advertorials are basically editorial content with the aim to sell. Think about articles that might be a news story or educational content with a call to action persuading you to buy a product or sign up for a free trial.

Some benefits of Advertorials are:

* Captures the reader’s interest and gains trust
* Gives your reader’s value, so they are more likely to purchase from you
* You can make your product or service stand out by telling unique customer stories

## **Advertorials Vs Advertising Copy**

Companies pay magazines for advertising space. They are sometimes listed on a separate page.

You may notice a short with a headline, image and a few sentences about the product along with a price and maybe a testimonial. This is an Advertising copy.

These are very different as they are written to sell directly. Whereas an advertorial should inform a reader in the same way as a magazine or newspaper article does.

However, when creating advertorials make sure you tell your readers up front what they are reading is paid content to prevent any confusion.

## **How to write an Advertorial**

### **Choose a topic**

Brainstorm various ideas that you would like to cover. E.g. If you are a music school. You might want to write about guitar lessons for adults.

### **Content structure**

Next, decide on your content’s structure. Here are some ideas:

1. Unusual results of people who have used your products and services
2. How to articles around your services and products. E.g. A bakery might write; how to make banana cake
3. Write content around a festive period
4. Recycle a piece of content and rewrite it in a new way
5. Use formulas: e.g. Behind the scenes at………., The art of………..

### **Choose your angle**

An angle is how you approach your story**.** There are a number of ways to do this.

_Human interest feature_

You could write a story about someone who has had unusual results using your products or services.

E.g. A client who used one of your collagen products has experienced enormous growth in a short period of time.

_Information features_

Here, you include all the relevant information about your product or service

* What is it?
* What does it do?
* What is its history?
* Who is it for?

_Analysis features_

As a company, you may want to discuss current issues directly linked to your products.

E.g. A recruitment agency may write about how Co Vid has affected the job market. Then they would then offer their services as a solution.

_Seasonal features_

Holidays are always coming and going. So you might decide you want to take advantage and promote your services during this festive period. You could promote during Christmas, Newyear or Easter.

### **Do Research**

Imagine you are writing for your Web Design company. You have chosen to write an article called How to create a website in a week. Now think about ways of finding relevant information for your article.

* You might do a Google search.
* Interview industry experts.
* Read books about your subject.

### **Write your outline**

* Use all your research to create a draft.
* In your outline include a headline. Write at least 10 headlines and choose the best one.
* Include an Introduction, Subheadings and Conclusion.
* Underneath your headings. Write a bulleted list of what you are going to include.
* Don’t forget to add interesting facts, quotes and links to other websites.

### **Write your article**

* Start writing and extend on what you have included in your outline
* Proofread and edit your article

### **You now know to write an advertorial. But here are some extra things to think about:**

1. Write in the tone and voice of your company. All your content should be cohesive
2. Your feature should be 500-700 words
3. Use plenty of quotes from staff and previous customers
4. Use the curiosity intro to intrigue readers by just giving them enough information to get them excited. E.g. A nutrition company wanting to inspire people to take care of their health might write: As she walked down the street. She felt a sharp pain in her chest and fell to the ground. When she woke up she was in a hospital bed.
5. Include a one-liner after the headline and before the introduction to set the scene
6. Use the conclusion to make readers think and include an offer

## **The takeaway**

If you are want to provide value to potential customers, create authority and showcase what sets you apart from your competition. Then, Advertorials are the way to go.
