Advertorials are a great option when it comes to promoting your business and increasing its revenue.

It kills two birds with one stone. It educates, helps customers and builds trust. As-well-as drives conversion.

In this article, I will discuss how Advertorials can help your business and how to create one.

## **What is an Advertorial?**

Advertorials are editorial content with the aim to sell. Think about articles that might be a news story or educational content with a call to action persuading you to buy a product or sign up for a free trial.

Some benefits of Advertorials are:

* Captures the reader’s interest and gains trust
* Gives your reader’s value, so they are more likely to purchase from you
* Make your product or service stand out by telling unique customer stories

## **Advertorials Vs Advertising Copy**

Companies pay magazines for advertising space. These Ads are often listed on a separate page.

An ad usually includes a headline, image and a few sentences about the product along with a price and maybe a testimonial.

These are very different as they are written to sell directly. Whereas an Advertorial should inform a reader in the same way as a magazine or newspaper article does.

However, when creating Advertorials make sure you tell your readers upfront what they are reading is paid content to prevent any confusion.

### **1. Choose a topic**

Brainstorm various ideas that you would like to cover. E.g. If you are a music school. You might want to write about guitar lessons for adults.

### **2. Choose your type of feature**

Advertorials come in different categories and you should choose a category that best portrays your topic.

**_Human interest feature_**

You could write a story about someone who has had unusual results using your products or services.

E.g. A client who used one of your collagen products has experienced enormous hair growth in a short period of time.

**_Information features_**

Here, include all the relevant information about your product or service

* What is it?
* What does it do?
* What is its history?
* Who is it for?

**_Analysis features_**

As a company, you may want to discuss current issues directly linked to your products.

E.g. A recruitment agency may write about how Co Vid has affected the job market. Then offer their services as a solution.

**_Seasonal features_**

Holidays are always coming and going. So take advantage and promote your services during a festive period. You could promote during Christmas, Newyear or Easter.

### **3. Choose your angle**

Your angle is how your approach your article. Try to be as unique as possible. For instance, if you are writing about how sports benefits children. You could start with:

17 reasons why children should do sport

Does lack of sport in childhood affect your mental health as an adult?

A 15-year-old school dropout tells us how dancing changed her life

### **4. Do Research**

Imagine you are writing for your Web Design company. You have chosen to write an article called How to create a website in a week. Now think about ways of finding relevant information for your article.

* You might do a Google search.
* Interview industry experts.
* Read books about your subject.

### **5. Write your headline**

Your headline is the most important part of your Advertorial. So, take your time and write at least 10 headlines before settling on the final one.

### **6. Include a one-liner after the headline**

Because an advertorial is similar to editorial content. It is essential to set the scene and prepare readers for what's coming up next. You can do this by writing a one-liner that expands on the headline.

### **7. Use a curiosity hook**

When writing your introduction for your advertorial use curiosity to lure your readers in. Give them just enough information to get them to read the next section.

E.g. A nutrition company wanting to inspire people to take care of their health might write: As she walked down the street. She felt a sharp pain in her chest and fell to the ground. When she woke up she was in a hospital bed.

### **8. Write an outline**

To begin:

* Brainstorm questions you think your audience might want to know about your topic
* Use these questions as your sub-headings
* Include your headline
* Include your introduction
* Don’t forget to add interesting facts, quotes from staff and previous customers.  As well as links to other websites.

### **9. Write your draft**

* Start writing and extend on what you have included in your outline.
* Don't stop to do research or editing. It interrupts the writing process. Write continuously.

### **10. Write in your tone of voice**

All your written content should represent your brand and be written in your company's tone of voice.

Think about how you want your company to come across. Do you want to sound serious, playful, educational, motivational? What are your brand's values and how you can write in a way that shows this in your content?

### **11. Write longer content**

Content such as ads don't need a lot of words. And blog posts tend to rank better over 1000 words. However, an advertorial should be between 500-700 words.

### **12. Edit your draft**

* Proofread and edit your article several times until you are satisfied with the outcome.
* Use tools like Grammarly and the Hemingway app to edit your work. You can also read your content out loud.

### **13. Conclude with an offer**

When writing the conclusion, finish your article by including an offer. You could include a discount for the product you are promoting. Or a free trial to persuade buyers to make the purchase.

## **The takeaway**

Advertorials will help you promote your business whilst providing value to potential customers. You can also create authority and showcase what sets you apart from your competition.
