You have a business or plan to start one. You're not interested in Social Media. So why not use [copywriting](https://www.ruthchernous.com/post/what-is-meant-by-copywriting-the-ins-and-outs/ "Copywriting for beginners") to market your business.

Advertising content is a good way of killing two birds with one stone by educating your customers whilst driving conversions.

In this article, I will discuss how to write advertising content such as Advertorials and Ads.

## **What is an Advertorial?**

Advertorials are editorial content with the aim to sell. Think about articles that might be a news story or educational content with a call to action persuading you to buy a product or sign up for a free trial.

Some benefits of Advertorials are:

* Captures the reader’s interest and gains trust
* Gives your reader’s value, so they are more likely to purchase from you
* Make your product or service stand out by telling unique customer stories

## **Advertorials Vs Ads**

Companies pay magazines for advertising space. These Ads are often listed on a separate page.

An ad usually includes a headline, image and a few sentences about the product along with a price and maybe a testimonial.

These are very different as they are written to sell directly. Whereas an Advertorial should inform a reader in the same way as a magazine or newspaper article does.

However, when creating Advertorials make sure you tell your readers upfront your article is paid content to prevent any confusion.

Some benefits of Ads are:

* They are a quick and effective way of promoting new products and services
* Helps you increase sales
* It is easy to stand out from your competition by creating unique graphics and promotional videos

## **How to write an advertorial**

### **1. Choose a topic**

Brainstorm various ideas that you would like to cover. E.g. If you own a music school. You might want to write about guitar lessons for adults.

### **2. Choose your type of feature**

Advertorials come in different categories and you should choose a category that best portrays your topic.

**_Human interest feature_**

You could write a story about someone who has had unusual results using your products or services.

E.g. A client who used one of your collagen products has experienced enormous hair growth in a short period of time.

**_Information features_**

Here, include all the relevant information about your product or service

* What is it?
* What does it do?
* What is its history?
* Who is it for?

**_Analysis features_**

As a company, you may want to discuss current issues directly linked to your products.

E.g. A recruitment agency may write about how Co Vid has affected the job market. Then offer their services as a solution.

**_Seasonal features_**

Holidays are always coming and going. So take advantage and promote your services during a festive period. You could promote during Christmas, Newyear or Easter.

### **3. Choose your angle**

Your angle is how you approach your article. Try to be as unique as possible. For instance, if you are writing about how sports benefits children. You could start with:

17 reasons why children should do sport

Does lack of sport in childhood affect your mental health as an adult?

A 15-year-old school dropout tells us how dancing changed her life

### **4. Do Research**

Imagine you are writing for your Web Design company. You have chosen to write an article called How to create a website in a week. Now think about ways of finding relevant information for your article.

* You might do a Google search
* Interview industry experts
* Read books about your subject

### **5. Write your headline**

Your headline is the most important part of your Advertorial. So, take your time and write a few headlines before settling on the final one.

### **6. Include a one-liner after the headline**

Because an advertorial is similar to editorial content. It is essential to set the scene and prepare readers for what's coming up next. You can do this by writing a one-liner that expands on the headline.

### **7. Use a curiosity hook**

When writing your introduction for your advertorial use curiosity to lure your readers in. Give them just enough information to get them to read the next section.

E.g. A nutrition company wanting to inspire people to take care of their health might write: As she walked down the street. She felt a sharp pain in her chest and fell to the ground. When she woke up she was in a hospital bed.

### **8. Write an outline**

To begin:

* Brainstorm questions you think your audience might want to know about your topic
* Use these questions as your subheadings
* Include your headline
* Include your introduction
* Don’t forget to add interesting facts, quotes from staff and previous customers. As well as links to other websites.

### **9. Write your draft**

* Start writing and extend on what you have included in your outline.
* Don't stop to do research or editing. It interrupts the writing process. Write continuously.

### **10. Write in your tone of voice**

All your written content should represent your brand and be written in your company's tone of voice.

Think about how you want your company to come across. Do you want to sound serious, playful, educational, motivational? What are your brand's values and how can you write in a way that portrays this?

### **11. Write longer content**

Content such as ads don't need a lot of words. And blog posts tend to rank better over 1000 words. However, an advertorial should be between 500-700 words.

### **12. Edit your draft**

* Proofread and edit your article several times until you are satisfied with the outcome.
* Use tools like Grammarly and the Hemingway app to edit your work. You can also read your content out loud.

### **13. Conclude with an offer**

When writing the conclusion, finish your article by including an offer. You could include a discount for the product you are promoting. Or a free trial to persuade buyers to make a purchase.

## **Tips for creating an Ad**

### **1. Find your audience**

Before writing make sure you know exactly who you are writing to by finding out who your target audience is. You can look at previous customers and create a profile based on that. Or you can use this [**tool.**](https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona)

### **2. Keep it short and concise**

Can you get your point across within 5 secs? Use short paragraphs and short words.

### **3. Use power words**

Include words like free, profit, new, now, secret, easy, save, guarantee, today, you in your content.

### **4. Use a list**

A bulleted or numbered list helps with formatting and makes it easy for readers to scan through your text.

### **5. Headlines**

Write headlines that:

* Include the benefits of your product or service
* Have a verb
* Shouldn’t have more than 6 words
* Use 1-2 word syllables per word

### **6. Look at your competition**

It is always helpful to know what your competition is doing and what they aren’t. Use what they aren’t doing to your advantage.

### **7. Sell benefits**

You’ve probably heard this before. But I will repeat it. Features don’t sell benefits. So, always think about what benefits your product has to offer.

### **8. Testimonials**

Customers are sceptical to buy without proof from others. So, include testimonials in your content. And if possible include the person’s full name and job title.

### **9. Use a money-back guarantee**

Customers feel safe buying from you when you include a money-back guarantee. As it lowers the risk of purchasing a product they don’t like. This is especially true for high ticket items.

### **10. Give options for payment**

Not everyone has a Paypal account. So, including multiple ways of payment could increase your conversions. However, include an SSL certificate to protect their data.

### **11. Use a CTA**

All this effort in writing content for your business is pointless without a call to action. A call to action is like the end goal. So, it might be useful to write the CTA first and work backwards.

E.g. Sign up to, Call now, Request a brochure

### **12. Make it flow**

Using conjunctions like And, But, So helps make different parts of your content tie into one another.

## **The takeaway**

Advertorials help promote your business whilst providing value to potential customers. 

Whereas Ads can help increase sales and showcase what sets you apart from your competition.

Whichever strategy you use will depend on your marketing goals.

So, what are your thoughts on including Advertorials and Ads as part of your marketing strategy?

If you were to create one. Are they any extra steps you would take?
