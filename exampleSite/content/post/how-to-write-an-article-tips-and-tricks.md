I’m sure you’re sick to death, hearing the word content marketing or [copywriting](https://www.ruthchernous.com/post/what-is-meant-by-copywriting-the-ins-and-outs/ "Copywriting for beginners").

But the truth is that it works.

So, in this post, we will be looking at how to write a damn good article for your business.

## **Types of articles**

Before we delve into writing. It is important to know that there are different types of articles. Why? Because you can tailor the different styles to what you are writing and who you are writing for.

Here are some main types:

* Features: These are usually used for writing travel essays, seasonal, and behind the scenes content
* Newsletters: Tell you what has just happened or what is going to happen and inform rather than entertain
* Reviews: Are when you critique something
* How to’s: Generally show you how to do something
* Research papers: Often goes in-depth into a subject and uses academic citations

## **Pitching**

Generally, as a business owner, your articles will be submitted on your website. But to get more eyes on it. It might be useful to pitch to a publisher. But how do you contact them? Do you call them? Write a letter? Actually, it's best to send an email.

Here’s what you need to create a successful email:

* Create a good subject line
* Address the editor by their name
* Summarize the subject matter and approach in 2-3 paragraphs
* Include sources( sources are where you plan to get your information from, your research)
* Include why you’re an expert on this topic
* Add a deadline for their decision
* Check spelling, grammar and check your facts

## **Research**

I read somewhere that you should spend 80% on research and 20% on writing. At the beginning of my writing journey, this confused me as I thought surely to get better at writing. You need to write. Yes, this holds true.

But it turns out without doing enough research. Writing feels like pulling teeth. With good research, an article practically writes itself.

Listed below are 3 main ways of doing research:

* Writing from your own knowledge
* Reading articles and books on your subject, watching videos
* Interviewing industry experts like professors, authors

When reaching out to people for an interview:

* Contact and ask for an interview
* Tell them what you are writing about and why
* Include where it will publish and when
* Tell them who the audience is

So you’ve contacted them and organised a date and time for the interview. Before going to the interview, there are a few things to prepare beforehand:

* Prepare short open-ended questions before the interview
* Start with easy questions and work up to difficult ones
* If you type slowly you might want to record your interview. But remember to ask for permission beforehand.

## **Writing the article**

### **Brainstorm**

Before you do anything, do a brainstorm of questions, facts, and information that you think you need to include in the article. If I was writing about Losing weight with protein shakes. You could start with:

* What is a protein shake
* Are protein shakes good for you
* How to make a protein shake?
* How many protein shakes should you have a day?

If you can’t think of anything. Type your topic into Google and use the section "people also ask" to give you ideas.

### **Choose your approach**

Different types of articles are written in different ways. For instance, the news article is written using the inverted pyramid.

A How-to article is written in chronological order. Other articles are written with a strong opinion with subheads that contain information.

That backs up your argument. Your choice will depend on the topic and the audience.

### **Writing an outline**

Will help you organise your ideas before filling in the blanks. Include your introduction or main argument or statement. Then decide what you want to include in the subheadings which should all support your argument.

Here is an example I have just created of how this might work to give you a better idea.

**Headline: Direct Mail is dead!**

**Introduction**

**If you're not on social media and are using direct mail for your marketing campaign in 2021. You’re throwing customers down the drain.**

**Subtitle 1: you might include some points from an article you read from an industry expert.**

**Write bulleted facts from a source that support your intro**

**E.g. According to Hubspot……**

**Add a link from your source here for reference.**

**Subtitle 2: You could include a summary of a story from a celebrity**

**E.g. Mary Knight, a successful entrepreneur and author tells us how she was able to increase her conversion rates by dropping Direct mail and turning to social media.**

**Write a bulleted list of important facts on how she did this**

**Add a link from your source here for reference.**

### **Connecting your ideas**

Each of your subheadings should have a single point instead of a combination of different ideas. But for your content to flow you need to transition between your ideas smoothly.

Some ideas on how to do this are:

* Insert a quote
* Use scene/ time setting phrases like last month
* Repeat an idea from the previous sentence
* Ask a question

### **Reference sources**

When writing, include references to your research. You don’t have to include a bibliography like you would in school. But you can reference them by using words like:

* According to so and so
* So and so reported
* So and so said

### **Editing**

After creating a detailed outline. It should be fairly easy to fill in the rest of the information. Once you’ve done that. Edit and proofread your work.

Here are some tips on how to do this:

* Print out your article as it makes it easier to see mistakes
* See if the language you’ve used is concise
* Delete any Jargon
* Read it out loud
* Run it through Grammarly and the Hemingway app
* Make sure it is the correct length. It shouldn’t be more or less than 20% of the word count.

### **Writing the conclusion**

The easiest way of doing this is to summarise the point of your article. But below are some other ideas:

* A quote from a source
* A prediction of what is coming up next
* An indication of a future event
* A question

## **Submitting your work**

Ok, so you've written and edited your work. Next, you need to prepare it for submission.

Here’s what you need to do:

* Include a suggested headline
* Add photos with captions explaining who and what is in the photo and who took the photo
* State your availability in case you need to be contacted about your article
* Don’t forget to include contact information for your sources
* Ask questions like when and where the article will be published
* Add a summary of yourself for your author bio

## **Promotion**

I found this quote “The only risk of failure is promotion - Scott Adams” and it’s so true. Even Though yes the publisher will do some promotion. It also helps to promote yourself to gain more awareness.

Starrshine Roshell in her[ video](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/writing-articles-2/how-to-write-an-article?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=false&autoplay=true&resume=true) states that she pulls out an interesting quote and shares it on her social media with a call to action leading her reader to find out more.

It is such an easy yet useful tactic. You can also add your article to your email signature, publish your article on Linked In and include your link to your next pitch.

## **Conclusion**

Learning to write articles is a valuable skill whether you plan on making money online.

Or you’re a business owner wanting to promote your business through content marketing.

So tell me.

Is this your first time writing an article or have you written one before?

If so, what did you struggle with the most?
