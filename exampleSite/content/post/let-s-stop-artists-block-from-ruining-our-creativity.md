Suffering from artists block is something that all artists can relate to. For those of you who haven’t experienced this, artists block is when you cannot generate ideas.

This can leave you feeling frustrated and unmotivated. Luckily there are ways to tackle this and get your creative juices flowing.

But first, let's look at what can block your creativity.

## **What causes artists block?**

Have you been in a situation where you grab your sketchbook raring to go?

Only to be met with a creative block. As an artist, I have been in this situation many times.

This usually happens when I haven't done enough research,  lack the skills to execute my ideas or lack confidence in my abilities.

### **Research**

Ideas usually come from looking at your interpretation of what is around you or other people's work. Simply collecting what inspires you can lead to a starting point.

### **Lack of skills**

Like they say practice makes perfect. If you are struggling to create your artwork as how you envisioned it. Just practise. Start by practising the techniques you need to achieve the final outcome.

### **Lack of confidence**

Feeling like your artwork isn't good enough is real.

I cannot keep count of how many times I have created a piece of artwork and binned it because I thought it wasn't good enough.

1 tip I learnt from art school is to never bin your artwork. By reworking and adapting old creations. You could build it into something spectacular.

## **How long does artists block last?**

Artists block varies from person to person. But it can last for a week to several months.  So how do you unblock your creativity?

## **How do you get rid of an artists block?**

### **Mind map**

If you find yourself staring at a blank page, one thing you can do is to create a mind map.

Draw a circle in the middle of your sketchbook and write down the topic of your project. Then, write down keywords related to your topic of choice.

### **Inspiration boards**

After creating a mindmap, choose a few keywords that grab your interest. Find images using those keywords online.

Or you can also take your own photographs. Create several themed boards. 3- 5 inspiration boards are plenty.

### **Other artists**

Another way to spark inspiration is to look at the work created by others. Take a trip to an art gallery or look through books. Study techniques created by the masters and try to imitate them. You never know where it might take you.

### **Trends**

To create something sellable, it is important for you to look at trends. Look through fashion and textile magazines and look at what is popular.

Ideally, you should look at and use trends that are not yet available. You can use trend forecasting tools or simply do some research on the net.

### **Music**

When going through an artistic block, the last thing you want to do is stress out. This can further affect your creativity.

Make a cup of tea and relax to some music. Get out your sketchbook and simply draw what emotion comes to mind. These might be abstract or figurative shapes. Experiment with various materials.

### **Go for a walk**

Leaving your house can be the perfect solution for your artistic block. Go into your garden or go for a walk. Don’t forget to take your camera or your sketchbook to capture anything which fascinates you.

### **Television**

This might not come to mind when you think of creativity. But watching your favourite shows can be a great source of inspiration.

Whilst watching television, try sketching what you see. This can be anything on the box which is interesting to you.

### **Challenges**

Taking part in challenges has been a popular choice to get involved in a community full of like-minded individuals.

Why not take part in a challenge on social media or create a challenge of your own. What’s more inspiring than sharing your artwork with other creatives.

### **Trade shows**

Like exhibitions, trade shows are the perfect place to network and look at products, showcased by other artists.

It is a great way of finding out about new and upcoming artists. When going to a tradeshow make sure to collect business cards, so you can use this information to do further research at home.

### **Journaling**

Writing your thoughts and feelings in a diary is a therapeutic process that can be used to stimulate creativity. You could create artwork based on your journal entries.

### **Sampling**

Maybe you've tried all of the techniques listed above and more.  Yet, you still aren't getting anywhere. In this situation, find a technique you love and create samples with your take on that technique.

## **What now? I still can't create anything**

You've tried all the methods listed. But you've had no luck. Then have a break. Workout, cook a meal, speak to a friend. Then come back to your work with a set of fresh eyes.

## **Conclusion**

Creating artwork doesn’t have to be difficult.

With these ideas under your belt, you can say goodbye to staring at a blank page and begin your creative process with excitement and ease.

What do you do when you experience a creative block?

Are there any methods you use that isn't listed above?
