Let’s be honest here, caring for any hair type can be a pain in the bum. But having afro hair can feel like a full-time job. 

A simple wash, condition and go will not suffice. We need to wash, condition, deep condition, use protein treatments, trim, do protective styles and more.

Between long work schedules or looking after children, when are we supposed to take care of our tresses? The answer is to find a day to do your hair and stick to it.

A bit like working out it has to be ingrained into your lifestyle. The good news is once you have found a routine that works for you, you are on your way to growing healthy hair.

So in this, I will include a simple hair routine that anyone can do.

_You will need:_

* Shampoo
* Deep conditioner
* Essential oils: Tea tree oil and Rosemary are good choices
* Leave-in conditioner
* Natural oils: I use castor oil but olive oil and coconut oil are also great for the hair.

## **Pre Pooing your hair**

Shampoos can strip your natural oils from your hair strands leaving them dry and brittle. 

[Pre-poo](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a35809146/prepoo-hair-care-tips/ "Pre-pooing your hair") can help combat this. To prepoo add a natural oil of your choice to your hair and leave it there for a minimum of 30 minutes. 

Some people prefer to leave it in for a couple of hours or sometimes overnight.

## **Shampooing your hair**

Hair must be cleaned with shampoo to remove dirt from the scalp. There are different types of shampoos available; moisturising, volumising, dandruff and more.

But a clarifying shampoo will help remove build-up. However, only use these monthly as it can dry out your hair.

Apple cider vinegar can also be used instead of shampoos to cleanse your hair. When using apple cider vinegar, dilute 1 part of apple cider with 3 parts of water. 

So if you use 1 tbsp of apple cider, add 3 tbsp of water. Undiluted apple cider can damage your hair due to its acidity.

## **Deep Conditioning your hair**

Your shampoo must be followed up by a conditioner. Shampooing strips your hair of its natural oils and moisture. So conditioners are used to add that moisture back into your hair.

There are 2 types of deep conditioner, protein and moisturizing. So which one do you use? Well, I think both. Use the protein if your hair is feeling weak and brittle and use the moisturising one when your hair feels dry.

## **Moisturizing your hair**

Applying a leave-in conditioner to your hair will leave it feeling soft and prevent it from breakage. I love making spritzes. I combine 1 part water to 1 part conditioner and add a few drops of essential oils to the mixture.

## **Sealing your hair**

Follow up with oil to seal in the conditioner. I use Jamaican castor oil as I love the thick texture. If you have thick curls that dries out quickly. Use hair butter after the oil. Opt for a natural butter like shea or mango butter.

So how often should you do this?

* Apply a leave-in conditioner or spritz and seal with an oil and butter daily
* Shampoo and deep condition your hair weekly
* Remove build-up with a clarifying shampoo or apple cider vinegar and use a protein treatment monthly

## **Protective hairstyles**

These are [low manipulation hairstyles](https://www.glamour.com/gallery/cute-protective-styles "low manipulation hairstyles") like buns, cornrows, box braids, weaves. Less manipulation means less breakage. So including these in your hair regime can be the difference between damaged hair prone to breakage and bouncy hair that pops.

## **The takeaway**

This routine shouldn’t be followed to a T. Adapt it according to your hair type and your lifestyle.

You might need to wash your hair less often if you have a desk job and wash it more often if you work out. However, I wouldn’t suggest washing it more than twice a week.
