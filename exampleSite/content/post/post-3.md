As black women our curly hair strands make it difficult for natural oils to travel down the hair shaft making it susceptible to breakage.

Giving us the label “ black hair doesn’t grow”. However there are certain things we can do to prevent this like adding Jamaican black castor oil to your hair regime.

### **What is black castor oil?**

Castor oil comes from the seed Ricinus Communis. It is found in Eastern Africa, India and the Mediterranean. The oil is extracted from the seed and cold pressed giving it a pale yellow colour.

The other type is called the Jamaican black castor oil. The process is different as the seeds are roasted and then vaporized in a mortar.

It is then boiled producing a dark brown colour. Castor oil has many uses such as pain relief, skin and hair treatment. It is found in various types of cosmetics ranging from lipsticks to deodorants.

### **So how is it beneficial for your hair?**

Well, Jamaican black castor oil benefits your hair because most oils are made of different combinations of fatty acids. Castor oil is different because it contains a fatty acid called Ricinoleic.

This fatty acid has elements that are anti-inflammatory and antifungal. It also increases circulation by attracting moisture from the environment to your hair and skin.

Most oils only contain a fraction of this fatty acid whereas castor oil contains 85%-95% of it.

### **Which is better for hair growth castor oil or Jamaican black castor oil?**

When it comes to the best castor for hair growth. The Jamaican castor oil is better because of the ash content from the roasting process. However castor oil is suitable for repairing hair breakage.

### **Can Jamaican black castor oil damage your hair?**

Jamaican castor oil can’t damage your hair and rarely irritates the skin. But you can’t predict how it will react to yours. So it is advisable to test it on a small area of skin before application.

Also putting it in your hair everyday can cause build-up because of the thickness of the oil. So wash your hair once a month with a clarifying shampoo or use an apple cider vinegar rinse.

Some disadvantages are that if you apply the oil at night, it will stain your sheets. So cover your hair or your pillow before going to sleep.

Also the smell can be overwhelming but adding essential oils like Lavender and Tea Tree can alleviate this.

### **How do you use Jamaican castor oil for hair growth?**

Apply the oil to your scalp. Massage the oil with your fingers or use a scalp massager. You can get these on Amazon for a decent price. Massaging your scalp will enable faster hair growth by stimulating your hair follicles.

**_For conditioning your hair_**

We all know conditioning strengthens your hair and prevents it from damage. Apply the oil straight onto your hair. Put on a plastic cap and sit under a heat cap for 30 minutes. Then rinse. Alternatively leave it overnight and rinse it out in the morning.

Creating your own pomade will not only allow you to style your hair but will provide you with other benefits. To begin:

* Melt the same amount of beeswax and castor oil. You can also use petroleum jelly instead of beeswax.
* Fill a pan halfway with water and put it on a stove
* Put a bowl inside the pan. Add the wax and castor oil in the bowl
* Once it has melted, mix and let it cool down
* Add some essential oils to the mixture. Don’t use more than 2 drops of essential oils to 1 tbsp of castor oil and beeswax
* Pour the pomade into the tin and allow it to cool

### **Can black castor oil grow your eyelashes?**

Black castor oil isn’t only used for growing your hair. It can also be used to grow your eyelashes. There are several ways to do this. 

You can dip a mascara brush in the oil and go over your lashes. If you don’t have a mascara brush, you can use an eyeliner brush. 

Alternatively, you can just dip your finger in the castor oil and spread it across your lashes and then let it absorb. If you get the oil in your eyes, don’t worry as it is safe. Simply wash your eyes with water.
