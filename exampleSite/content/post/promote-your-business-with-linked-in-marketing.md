So, therefore my profile always consisted of my educational background and work history.

But learning more about Linked In has shown me the endless possibilities this platform has to offer.

So if your company sells B2B products or services, then Linked In Marketing is the way to go to push your small business to the next level.

In this article, I will show you how to market your business on Linked In.

Before you start creating your post you need to know who your audience is and what you want them to do.

Then, choose 2-3 themes or topics which form the basis of your posts. This helps build your credibility in those areas.

Next, create a headline. Using a question creates the most engagement. But there are different ways to create a good headline.

Your post should be 20 to 30 words long and it should build enough curiosity to persuade your reader to click on your website.

Add a custom image or graphic. As they are more attention-grabbing than stock images.

Include a call to action. Call to actions are words like:

* Learn more
* Buy now
* Subscribe
* Leave a comment

They tell your reader what action to take after reading your post.

Finish your post by adding 2-3 hashtags. They help users find your posts.

E.g. With winter coming, keeping your family healthy can be a challenge. However healthy smoothies are quick and easy to keep their immune system strong during the cold, winter months.

**Taking the time to create good content helps you appear higher in the search ranks and allows other people on LinkedIn to see your content.**

**Now you might be thinking well I know I need to create good content but what types of content can I share?**

**Here are some ideas:**

* **Create an article on LinkedIn**

Keep in mind that your article should be between 300 to 500 words. Also, share your article on your page to get it in front of viewers

* **Blog post**

Similar to an article you can also create a blog post and share the link on your page. When writing a blog post or article. Include subheadings as they help readers scan your information to the section they find the most relevant. Use images and bullets to break up your text and include lots of white space. You shouldn’t have more than four sentences in each paragraph.

You can also share blog posts from other websites. Before sharing. Write a quick summary of your take on the blog posts and share the link.

* **Pictures**

Be creative with your pictures. Take your images yourself, create collages or create graphics using sites like Canva, Photoshop or Illustrator.

* **Videos**

Readers love videos. They are engaging and can be used to teach or showcase your products. Make your videos 1 to 2 minutes long and have subtitles for people who may not want to watch your video with the sound on.

* **PowerPoints and PDFs**

Use Slideshare to upload powerpoints to share with your audience.

* **Moments in your business**

If you have images and videos of business and team building events you can include those. Readers are excited to see what goes on within your company.

### **4. Publish and Share**

Creating content isn't enough, you need to publish and share your content at the right time and with the right people.

The best way to do this is to create a few posts at different times of the day. Then go to your LinkedIn Analytics and see which times were the most popular. Post your content during those times.

Also, research shows that the best time to post is from 7:30 to 8:30 A.M, 12 PM and 5-6P.M.

### **5. Manage your content**

You’ve created your profile and come up with your content. Now you need to manage your page. You do this by:

1. Sharing consistently
2. Encouraging conversations by asking questions
3. Targeting each post to a relevant target audience
4. Create Linked In polls to engage followers
