Research is the difference between great and mediocre content.

If you didn’t know Google penalizes you if the content on your website is a replica of someone else’s.

Google wants to solve the user’s problem efficiently and doesn’t want several copies of the same thing in its database.

There are many ways writers might approach the research phrase. Some might do all their research upfront. Others might research as they go along.

I don’t think the approach matters along as the final outcome speaks to your audience.

So in this article, I will show 11 research methods you shouldn't ignore when writing content for your business.

## **1. Market Research**

During your[ copywriting](https://www.ruthchernous.com/post/what-is-meant-by-copywriting-the-ins-and-outs/ "Copywriting for beginners") research, the first thing you should ask yourself is:

1. Who are you writing for?
2. What problem are you solving?

If you don’t know then I suggest you stop what you are doing and answer these questions. Your content should feel like you are speaking to one person as opposed to many.

To help you get the ball rolling, create a persona. A persona is your ideal client for your business. This persona should include:

* Demographics: Age, location, salary, race, ethnicity, marital status, education and employment.
* Goals and motivation
* Pain points
* Main objections
* Interests

The second question is important as all marketing addresses a need or problem. I recently read the boron letters written by Gary Halbert to his son during his time behind bars. You can find these letters [**here.**](https://morgancrozier.com/boron-letters/)

He shared a story of his time as a copywriting teacher. Whereby, he asked students to imagine they each had a burger stand and their stand had one advantage.

Some of his students chose premium meat, others chose buns with seeds etc. He said if he had one advantage it would beat everyone else’s. Can you guess his advantage? It was a starving crowd.

This statement really resonated with me. Because similar to the burger story your content needs a starving crowd. You need to find an audience so desperate to consume your content because it solves their problem.

## **2. Company research**

When writing content for your business.  You should know jot down everything about your business. This will help you create content that aligns with your brand. Start with these questions:

* What is your story?
* How did you start your business?
* What are your achievements?
* What are your business goals?
* Who are your competitors?

## **3. Product Research**

You really should know everything about a product before selling it. The best way to get to know your product is to try it and find out its features and benefits. Take note of how using the product changed your life?

## **4. Your target audience**

For customers to read your content. You need to grab their attention quickly. And what better way to do that than to get inspiration from them.

You can get inspiration by hanging out where they hang out and using their language to write your copy.

For instance, you scroll through your company’s social media and in the comments section, something has grabbed your interest. You could use that as inspiration for your introduction or add it as a quote in your content.

## **5. How do research on Google?**

_Basic search_

When using Google to do copywriting research. It is easiest to start with a basic search. Go to the search bar and insert a keyword or phrase that relates to your business.

You can look for the location of something by writing the location next to the search phrase. E.g. Copywriter London.

If you prefer to use your voice, you can select the microphone and speak into it. Use words that you think you will find on the site you are looking for.

_Advanced search_

If you are looking for something specific it is better to try an advanced search. You can combine keywords or you can search by date or country.

_Google Scholar_

Contains numerous published e-journals in different subject areas. These articles include a bibliography or a list of references that you can use for further research.

## **6. Books**

This is the method I use the most in combination with the web when I am researching. I go on Amazon and download a sample of a book. Sometimes I use the information in the sample, on other occasions I invest in the book.

Another option is to use Google books or go to a library and get a hard copy of the book. I love books as the information is accurate and there is a wealth of information.

I like getting different books and pulling up the most interesting information as-well-as using my own knowledge to recreate a new piece.

## **7. Social media**

If you’re still stuck for ideas after researching Google. You can also find information on social media. Most social media sites have a search bar where you can include a phrase or a relevant keyword. Remember to put a hashtag alongside the keyword.

## **8. Amazon**

Reading your customer's reviews is a great way of doing research. Go through the reviews and use them as inspiration for your copywriting content.

Also, you could go to Amazon, find some books in your business niche and read the reviews.

## **9. Surveys**

When creating surveys for research, make sure your questions include qualitative data. Qualitative data doesn’t involve numbers and usually involves open-ended questions that analyze consumer behaviours.

You can email your surveys to customers on social media or by adding them to your website.

Offering a reward in exchange for completing the survey is a good way of persuading people to take part.

## **10. Interviews**

Interviewing is a great way of validating those pain points you have spotted using the previous techniques.

These interviews can be held on the phone, by Skype or in person. Interview your customers and experts in your industry.

## **11. Competitors**

Research doesn’t just end with your business, products and consumers. You should also be aware of your competitors.

What sort of content are they producing on their blogs and website?

How much traffic are they generating from that content?

You can use SEMRush to see where your competitors are getting their backlinks from and what keywords they are ranking for.

You can also gauge what to include in your copy by reading what your competitors have included and left out.

## **Final thoughts**

There is no set way of doing research. I think it all depends on the project. Sometimes you might use all these techniques or you might prefer to focus on one.

The most important thing is that your content brings something new to the table and offers value to your readers and potential customers.

So what is your go-to method when creating content?
