+++
Before beginning my journey as a copywriter I had no idea what copywriting was. A friend once spoke about doing copywriting as a side gig alongside teaching and I remember thinking to myself " what does a copywriter even do?"

Weirdly, I didn't ask and didn't think about it till my interest in online marketing began. The funny thing is before then, I saw copywriting everywhere. In ads, on billboards, I was even doing it on social media without realising.

So if you’re sitting there wondering the same thing. Don’t worry I have you covered.

In this article, I will write about what copywriting entails and how to find work.

## **What is copywriting and how does it work?**

So what is meant by copywriting? Copywriting is the act of using words to sell a service or product. A copywriter might write:

* **Slogans**: A short phrase used in advertising. Some famous ones are finger-licking good (KFC), Just do it - (Nike), I’m loving it - (Mcdonalds).
* **Brochures**: A book created by a business selling its products or services.
* **Leaflets**: Similar to brochures but it is a single sheet of paper with information about a business's products or services.
* **Web SEO**: Written content for your business website or blog that ranks well on Google.
* **Direct mail**: Written content about your business that is posted to customers through their letterbox.
* **Press releases**: Information or a story about a business and its products that are sent to magazine or newspaper publishers for promotion.
* **Video Scriptwriting**: Information that is written to support video content.
* **Social Media**: Captions that are written in posts for promotion.
* **Advertisements**: Content written in ads. These can be ads in newspapers or online like Google ads or social media.

I have named several but the list isn’t extensive. There are more types of copywriting content you could focus on that isn’t included in this list.

## **What exactly does a copywriter do?**

### If you are working for an agency you will:

* Be sent a brief and examples of similar content liked by their clients.
* Given keywords and background information on the company, you are writing for.
* Do extra research based on the information you are given.
* Write your content and input the keywords into your copy.
* Proofread and edit your content.
* Submit your content and make any revisions.

### What does a freelance copywriter do?

* Find companies to pitch to.
* Set up a phone call to find out more about the client goals.
* Send a questionnaire relating to their target audience and brand story. This helps you understand their brand’s tone of voice and how to write for their audience.
* You might be given keywords or you may have to find suitable keywords for the client. For the latter, you will have to do keyword research using Google or other tools like SEMRUSH or AHREFS.
* Write the content and insert relevant keywords.
* Edit and proofread the content.
* Submit and make any revisions.

## **How to become a copywriter**

Luckily you don't need any qualifications to become a copywriter. However, it is advisable that you sign up for one. Doing a copywriting course allows you to practise different copywriting techniques and build a portfolio to send to agencies and companies.

However, not everyone can afford to pay for a course. In this situation, you can teach yourself. To begin, find examples of different types of content. Some examples are leaflets that come in your postbox, promotional emails and articles. Think of ways you could rewrite these.

Practise writing headlines as they are the most important element to write. Without good headlines, readers won’t click on your content. You could start collecting these examples to create a swipe file.

A swipe file is a collection of written content that can be used to inspire your writing. I sometimes get stuck when writing headlines. So I often look at examples of headlines for inspiration and think of how I can rewrite them in my own way.

Another option is to use [**headline formulas**](https://copyblogger.com/10-sure-fire-headline-formulas-that-work/ "Headline Formulas")**.** These have been tried and tested and are used regularly by marketers.

## **What skills are needed to be a copywriter?**

### Writing

Obviously, you need to be able to write well. But writing doesn’t just include jotting down your thoughts on a piece of paper. You need to be able to write in different voices, styles and for different types of content.

### Research

Without good research, writing original content will feel like pulling teeth. It is important to get ideas from different sources like books, videos, articles, podcasts. Anything you can get your hands on that is relevant to the topic you are writing.

### Editing and Proofreading

This stage requires you to read through your content and rearrange elements that don't fit together. Remember to check for grammar and punctuation mistakes. Of course, no one is perfect which is why using tools like Grammarly helps.

### Good vocabulary

Luckily I was a language teacher before copywriting. So my vocabulary wasn't too bad, to begin with. But if you feel this isn’t your strong suit, you can improve your vocabulary by reading books which leads to my next point.

### Reading

Let's face it, to be a better writer you need to read. Reading helps you when structuring written content which is useful when creating your own media.

### Curiosity

I will be honest here. If you’re not a curious person, you might struggle in this field. You should want to dive deep into a topic not because it is expected from your client but because you want to.

The thirst for knowledge should excite you. And guess what? The more information you have. The more you have to play with.

## **How to find copywriter jobs?**

As a freelancer when it comes to offering your services, there is always the question of should I niche down or not. From one perspective not niching down might allow you to take on more work.

But the downside is having to compete with other copywriters that may be qualified and have more experience than you.

Personally, I think it is a good idea to write for an industry that you have experience in. This can be professionally or it can be a topic you know a lot about.

That way it is easy for you to differentiate from your competition and charge more money.

### Pitching

Finding a niche isn’t enough. It is also important to do some background research on the companies you want to work for. List them down and follow them on social media.

Keep notes on what type of content they produce. This will help when you approach them as you will already be familiar with their company.

### Social media and blogging

When it comes to offering your services, social media and blogging are your best friend. Start a blog showcasing your skills and knowledge in copywriting or the industry you are specializing in.

Also, optimize your content with keywords used by companies or individuals you want to work for.

### Upwork

Finding copywriting jobs is not for the faint-hearted. You might get rejections but don’t give up.

I started off working with a company on Upwork. Even though I was getting $10 for 500 words which is next to nothing as the average pay is $50 for 500 words.

I focused on getting experience rather than on getting money. However, don’t get caught up with doing this for a long period of time. Always have a time limit in mind and part ways when you are ready.

### Job boards

Some people may not fancy Upwork. So in this case sites like Pro blogger and Freelance copywriting jobs are useful for finding gigs.

If you struggle to find jobs in your niche. Don’t let your lack of experience hold you back. Look at what is listed, the requirements and write tailored samples for those specifications.

### Agencies

These guys are often looking for writers to work with. Send them an introductory letter and share information about yourself and your copywriting experience. Look for marketing and web design agencies or agencies in your niche.

## **How much should I charge as a copywriter?**

The best way to do this is to look at what you want to make annually. Look at job sites and find out how much money people with your experience are getting.

When doing this make sure to charge higher than you would get working for an agency to cover things like insurance and pension.

Some copywriters charge per word, others charge per hour or per project. It is still helpful to know how much money you are charging per hour irrespective of how you decide to charge your clients.

I think a fixed price for the whole project works well as there are no hidden costs for the clients. Always take a 50% deposit upfront. So clients don’t disappear without paying you.

## **The bottom line**

Now you know the ins and outs of being a copywriter. I think copywriting is a great career because it is in demand with excellent chances of growth and income. And best of all you don’t need any qualifications to get started.
