Before beginning my journey as a copywriter I had no idea what copywriting was. I knew I was interested in marketing. But it wasn’t till I delved deeper into digital marketing, copywriting found me.

The funny thing is before then, I saw copywriting everywhere. In ads, on billboards, I was even doing it on social media. So if you’re sitting there wondering the same thing. Don’t worry I have you covered.

**What is copywriting and how does it work?**

So what is meant by copywriting? Copywriting is the act of using words to sell or promote a service or product. When writing it is better to write with fewer words and get straight to the point. As a copywriter you might write:

* **Slogans**: A short phrase used in advertising. Some famous ones are finger-licking good (KFC), Just do it - (Nike), I’m loving it - (Mcdonalds)
* **Brochures**: A book created by a business selling its products or services
* **Leaflets**: Similar to brochures but is a single sheet of paper with information about a business’s products or services
* **Web SEO**: Written content for your business website or blog that ranks well on google.
* **Direct mail**: Written content about your business that is posted to customers through their letterbox.
* **Press releases**: Information or a story about a business and its products that is sent to magazine or newspaper publishers for promotion
* **Video Scriptwriting**: Information that is written to support video content
* **Social Media**: Captions that are written in posts for promotion
* **Advertisements**: Content written in ads. These can be ads in newspapers or online like google ads or social media

I have named several but the list isn’t extensive. There are more types of copy you can focus on that isn’t included in this list.

**What exactly does a copywriter do?**

_If you are working for an agency:_

* You will be sent a brief and examples of similar content liked by the clients.
* You will be given keywords and background information on the company you are writing for.
* You will then do extra research based on the information you are given
* You will then write your content and input the keywords into the copy.
* You will proofread and edit your content
* Finally, submit and make any revisions

_If you are working for yourself you will most likely have to:_

* Find companies to pitch to
* Set up a phone call to find out more about the client goals
* Send a questionnaire relating to their target audience and brand story. This helps you understand their brand’s tone of voice and how to write for their audience.
* You might be given keywords or you may have to find suitable keywords for the client. For the latter, you will have to do keyword research using Google or other tools like SEMRUSH or AHREFS
* Write the content and insert relevant keywords
* Edit and proofread the content
* Sent it to your client
* Make any revisions

**What do you need to do to become a copywriter?**

Luckily you don’t have to have a qualification to become a copywriter. However, it is advisable that you sign up for one. Doing copywriting courses allows you to practise different copywriting techniques and build a portfolio to send to agencies and companies.

However, not everyone can afford to pay for a course. In this situation, you can teach yourself. To begin, find examples of different types of content. Some examples are

leaflets that come in your postbox, promotional emails and articles. Think of ways you could rewrite these.

Practise writing headlines as they are the most important element to write. Without good headlines, readers won’t click on your content. You could start collecting these examples to create a swipe file.

A swipe file is a collection of written content that can be used to inspire your writing. I sometimes get stuck when writing headlines. So I often look at examples of headlines for inspiration and think of how I can rewrite them in my own way.

**What skills are needed to be a copywriter?**

_Writing_

Obviously, you need to be able to write well. But writing doesn’t include jotting down your thoughts on a piece of paper. You need to be able to write in different voices, styles and for different types of content.

Writing for social media vastly differs from the way you write for a press release or a blog. Also, you need to be able to articulate your ideas clearly.

_Research_

Without good research, writing original content will feel like pulling teeth. It is important to get ideas from different sources like books, videos, articles, podcasts. Anything you can get your hands on that is relevant to the content you are writing.

_Editing and proofreading_

This stage requires you to read through your content and rearrange elements that don't fit together. Remember to check for grammar and punctuation mistakes. Of course, no one is perfect which is why using tools like Grammarly helps.

_Good vocabulary_

Luckily I was a language teacher before getting into this career. So my vocabulary isn’t too bad. If you feel this isn’t your strong suit, you can improve your vocabulary through books which leads to my next point.

_Reading_

Let's face it, to be a better writer you need to read. Reading helps you see how to structure a piece of writing which is useful when creating your own content.

_Curiosity_

I will be honest here. If you’re not a curious person, you might struggle in this field. You should want to dive deep into a topic not because it is expected from your client but because you want to. The thirst for knowledge should excite you. And guess what the more information you have. The more you have to play within your writing.

**How do I get copywriting gigs?**

As a freelancer when it comes to offering your services there is always the question of should I niche down or not. From one perspective not niching down might allow you to take more work.

But the downside is having to compete with other copywriters that may be qualified and have more experience than you.

Personally, I think it is a good idea to write for an industry that you have experience in. This can be professionally or it can be a topic you know a lot about. That way it is easy for you to differentiate from your competition and charge more money.

**Pitching**

Finding a niche isn’t enough. It is also important to do some background research on the companies you want to work for. List them down and follow them on social media. Keep notes on what type of content they produce. This will help when you approach them as you will already be familiar with their company.

**Social media and blogging**

When it comes to offering your services, social media and blogging are your best friend. Start a blog showcasing your skills and knowledge in copywriting or the industry you are specializing in. Also, optimize your content with keywords used by companies or individuals you want to work for.

**Upwork**

Finding copywriting jobs is not for the faint-hearted. You might get rejections but don’t give up. I started off working with a company on Upwork. Even though I was getting $10 for 500 words which is next to nothing, the average is $50 for 500 words.

I focused on getting experience rather than on gaining money. However, don’t get caught up with doing this for a long period of time. Always have a time limit in mind and part ways when you are ready.

**Job boards**

Some people may not fancy Upwork. So in this case sites like Pro blogger and Freelance copywriting jobs are useful for finding you gigs. If you struggle to find jobs in your niche. Don’t let your lack of experience hold you back. Look at what is listed, the requirements and write tailored samples for specifications.

**Agencies**

These guys are often looking for writers to work with. Send them an introductory letter and share information about yourself and your copywriting experience. Look for marketing and web design agencies or agencies in your niche.

**How much should I charge as a copywriter?**

The best way to do this is to look at what you want to make annually. Look at job sites and find out how much money people with your experience are getting. When doing this make sure to charge higher than you would get working for an agency to cover things like insurance and pension.

Some copywriters charge per word, others charge per hour or per project. It is still helpful to know how much money you are charging per hour irrespective of how you decide to charge your clients.

I think a fixed price for the whole project works well as there are no hidden costs for the clients. Always take a 50% deposit upfront. So clients don’t disappear without paying you.

Now you know the ins and outs of being a copywriter. Copywriting is a great career because it is in demand with excellent chances of growth and income. And best of all you don’t need any qualifications to get started.
