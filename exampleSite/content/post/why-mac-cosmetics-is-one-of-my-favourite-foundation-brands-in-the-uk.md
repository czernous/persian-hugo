+++
Foundation for me was a thing of the past due to living in Asia for several years. I found that the heat would melt my makeup within seconds. So my makeup routine consisted of black eyeliner and bright lipstick.

When I finally came back to England, I couldn’t help but notice my highly pigmented skin. In the past, I had always opted for drug store brands like Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse or Loreal True Match.

Maybelline gave me great coverage but felt heavy on my skin. And Loreal didn’t give me enough coverage. So, this time I decided to go for a high-end brand. But I couldn’t decide on which one.

Then I remembered vague memories of friends talking about how much they loved Mac and how MAC Cosmetics was one of the best brands in the UK.

Although I was swayed by past memories. I chose Mac because of its variety in skin tones and the price point.

So I headed to a mac cosmetics shop near me. At the time the closest was Westfields in London.

After a conversation about what shade I was looking for. I began trying samples. The sales assistant noticed that my face and body were different skin tones; my face was darker than my body.

So, I was faced with two decisions, matching my face to the rest of my body so opting for a lighter foundation. Or matching my face colour. I decided to go for the previous option.

After months of using this product, I have decided to write an honest review and share it in this article.

## **My skin type**

As you guys probably know there are various skin types. The main ones are oily, combination and dry. My skin is oily. So, I knew I wanted a foundation with good oil control. I am terrible at matching foundations so luckily Mac has 2 colour systems.

The NW is neutral warm and is for neutralizing cool and pink undertones and NC which stands for neutral cool for neutralizing warm, yellow undertones.

In terms of my skincare, my routine is very simple. I use a charcoal face wash by Garnier skin naturals followed by a Nivea moisturiser twice a day.

Every so often I will use a clay mask to get rid of impurities. I know I should use a toner but to be honest I haven’t found one that I like so any suggestions are welcome.

## **Application**

There are various ways to apply foundation. You can use a beauty blender or your fingers. I like to use a foundation brush as I don’t like messy fingers.

I put the foundation on the back of my hand, dip the brush in the foundation and apply it to my face. I then dab the foundation on my forehead, cheeks and chin and blend it out.

The foundation I bought doesn’t come with a pump but there is an option of paying extra to get one with a pump which does make life easier.

Depending on your method of application you may use the foundation on its own. But I like to apply a primer underneath, followed by a setting powder in a similar shade.

## **My results**

I love the texture and consistency of this foundation. It is not too thick but at the same time gives enough coverage. It also blends and matches my skin tone perfectly. I also haven’t experienced any caking.

My pigmentation does start to peek through by the end of the day in hot weather. But I simply add more setting powder to my face if I'm still out.

It is a medium coverage foundation. So if you are looking for full coverage it probably isn’t for you. However, if you looking for something breathable then this product is a great choice.

## **Value for money**

For a 30 ML bottle, I paid £29. I bought it in July and still have some left. It is more expensive than Nars priced £28.00 and less expensive than Bobby Brown at £36.50.

Nars Soft Matte Complete Foundation is also oil-free, gives you 16-hour wear and looks natural. It protects your skin from pollution and blue light. And is available in 34 shades.

Another competitor is Bobby Brown’s Skin Long-Wear Weightless Foundation. It also lasts for 16 hours and is light on the skin. It works for normal- oily skin types, is moisturizing and instantly hides redness and discolouration.
